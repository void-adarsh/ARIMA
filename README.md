# ARIMA
The Stock Market, as we know, is volatile in nature and the prediction of the same is a cumbersome task. Stock prices depend upon not only economic factors but they relate to various physical, psychological, rational and other important parameters. In this project work, the stock prices are predicted using the Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) Model. Stock price predictive models have been developed and run on published stock data acquired from Yahoo Finance. The experimental results lead to the conclusion that ARIMA Model can be used to predict stock prices for a short period of time with reasonable accuracy.
